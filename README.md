# golang-keychain

### what does it do 

I was looking for a tool to help a friend  to bulk import passwords from CSV to keychain (Mac) and i could not find anything useful out there. so i decided this tool.

### what does it do 

The tool does the following :

- read the CSV file 
- Walk through the content and write out content into struct
- Read csv content into a keychain

### what does it do 

For now, just clone and run. change the name of the csv file 

### what does it do  

- Add command line options 
- more write up
- provide binnary options
- testing
